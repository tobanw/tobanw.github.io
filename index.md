I'm a Data Scientist at [Prosper](https://www.prosper.com/), where I build machine learning models for credit, fraud, marketing, and more.
I earned a PhD in Economics from the University of Pennsylvania, where [my research](https://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/2906/) centered on the empirical study of marriage markets using equilibrium matching models.
During my PhD, I developed a Julia package, [MarriageMarkets.jl](https://github.com/tobanw/MarriageMarkets.jl), for solving equilibria of various marriage market models.
I'm also an [Insight Data Science](https://www.insightdatascience.com/) alum (Summer 2017, Silicon Valley).

I'm an unabashed computer nerd with a strong preference for keyboard-driven interfaces (take note of the keyboard navigation on this website).
My essentials are:

* Arch Linux with [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/), a keyboard-first tiling window manager
* zsh for handy [shell plugins](https://ohmyz.sh/)
* vim (more specifically, [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)), a text editor with the mind-blowing power of [composable commands](http://ismail.badawi.io/blog/2014/04/23/the-compositional-nature-of-vim/)
* [ranger](https://ranger.github.io/), a vim-inspired console file manager
* [qutebrowser](http://www.qutebrowser.org/), a vim-inspired web browser

Check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/tobanw/dotfiles) to see how I configure them.

I'm very excited about [Julia](https://julialang.org/), a powerful new scientific computing language which is poised to win over a large chunk of mindshare from Python / R / Matlab / Fortran / C++.
