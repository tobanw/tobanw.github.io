I'm a Data Scientist at [Uber Freight][uberfreight], where I work as an economics specialist, optimizing pricing and matching for the Uber Freight marketplace.
I have a PhD in Economics from the University of Pennsylvania, where [my research][dissertation] centered on the empirical study of marriage markets using equilibrium search & matching models.
I'm also an [Insight Data Science][insight] alum (Summer 2017, Silicon Valley).

During my PhD, I developed a Julia package, [MarriageMarkets.jl][package], for solving equilibria of various marriage market models.
I remain very interested in the [Julia language][julia], a powerful new scientific computing language which is poised to win over a large chunk of mindshare from Python / R / Matlab / Fortran / C++.

I'm an unabashed computer nerd with a strong preference for keyboard-driven interfaces (take note of the keyboard navigation on this website).
My essentials are:

* Arch Linux with [i3wm][i3], a keyboard-first tiling window manager
* zsh for [handy shell plugins][awesome-zsh]
* Vim (more specifically, [Neovim][nvim]), a text editor with the mind-blowing power of [composable commands][vim-compose]
* [ranger][ranger], a vim-inspired console file manager
* [qutebrowser][qutebrowser], a vim-inspired web browser
	* [tridactyl][tridactyl] is a great Firefox addon providing similar functionality

Check out [my dotfiles][dotfiles] to see how I configure them.

Naturally, I'm a bit of an ergonomic keyboard connoisseur.
My daily driver is the [Kinesis Advantage][kinesis-advantage] (modified with some [O-rings][o-rings] to reduce travel on keys farther from the home row).
My other keyboard is the [Keyboardio Model-01][model01].
Both keyboards are a pleasure to type on.
