I recently completed the [Insight Data Science Fellowship](http://insightdatascience.com/) and am now a Data Scientist at [Prosper](https://www.prosper.com/).

My background is in economics, and my PhD research was on the empirical study of marriage markets using equilibrium matching models.
I also love computers and code! I get excited about linux, vim, python, julia, and more.
