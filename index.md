I'm a PhD student in Economics at the University of Pennsylvania.
I'm broadly interested in applied microeconomics.
My current research is focused on the marriage market in an equilibrium search framework.

I also love computers and code! I get excited about

- linux
- vim
- python
- julia
- and more...

I'm involved with running [Penn Effective Altruism](http://pennea.org), a student group that focuses on the most effective ways to improve the world.
I manage the website and run the new [80,000 Hours](http://pennea.org/80k-hours) chapter.
