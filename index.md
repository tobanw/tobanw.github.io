I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Pennsylvania.
My research is focused on the empirical study of marriage markets within an equilibrium search and matching framework.
I also love computers and code! I get excited about linux, vim, python, julia, and more.

I'm looking to make a transition into data science in the tech industry.
I'll be participating in the [Insight Data Science Fellowship](http://insightdatascience.com/) this summer in Silicon Valley.

I'm involved with [Penn Effective Altruism](http://pennea.org), a student group that focuses on the most effective ways to improve the world.
I manage the website and run the [80,000 Hours](http://pennea.org/80k-hours) career workshops.
